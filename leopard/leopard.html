         <h1 id="text">Snow leopards are native to the mountains of Central and South Asia. Snow leopards are well adapted to the cold and high altitudes. Snow leopards can travel 25 miles in a one night. Snow leopards, contrary to their name, are actually a closer relative to the tiger compared to the leopard. They are a vulnerable status species and have a total estimated population of around 5,500. Snow leopards can leap six times the length of its body. Snow leopards are apex predators, which means they are at the top of the food chain sans us humans. They are usually killed by farmers because snow leopards prey on livestock. Natural prey can be harder to find, so they are forced to kill livestock for survival. Fun fact: Mac OS X 10.6 is named after the snow leopard. </h1>
