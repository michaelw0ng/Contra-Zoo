         <h1 id="text">Gray wolves are highly social canines that form packs. Packs is generally a family of seven wolves, including parents and offspring. Within the pack, wolves have dynamic social heirarchy which is based on attitude and confidence rather than intelligence, strength or speed. Younger wolves stay in their parents' pack for two years before some joining other packs. Wolves are carnivores that generally hunt for mammal meat. Male wolves can weigh around 100 pounds. Wolves' sense of smell is 100 times stronger than human's. They will use urine to mark territory and for location purposes. The average life span of a wolf is around 7 years. Dogs are direct descendents of the gray wolf or domesticated wolves. However, wolves are generally bred in the wild, while dogs are bred by humans, so their behavior is very different. </h1>
