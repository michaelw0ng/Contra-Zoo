         <h1 id="text">Lop eared bunnies are rabbits that have ears that droop down. The lopping of the ears is genetically selected by breeders and is not found in nature due to its detriment to their hearing. However, the lop rabbit is, nonetheless, extremely popular, representing over half of all pet rabbits in the UK. Although, certainly cute, lop eared bunnies may have increased issues related to their ears and teeth as shown by research done by Johnson and Burn. Rabbits were formerly categorized as Rodents but are no longer categorized as such. However, I must say that there are very cute bunnies that are not lop eared and do not have the issues that come with lop eared bunnies. One thing to note for prospective bunny owners is that bunnies chew to keep their teeth short so they may chew on your wires. However, wire chewing can be avoided by encasing wires with split loom tubing or placing wires out of reach from the bunny.</h1>
